    <string name="mornin_delight_review">This was my first time trying Md during the release. Prior to the release, I opened my bcbs 2014/13 and Kbs 15/12 and bcbs vr 2014 to remind myself of what goodness should be. And MD was up there with VR. The aroma/taste reminded me of slow drip coffee from single origin coffee beans blended perfect with maple syrup. The body was perfect as it had a fuller month feel than a Kbs but not as full as a VR. </string>
